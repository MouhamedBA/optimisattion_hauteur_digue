# optimisattion_hauteur_digue

The goal of this industrial reliability project is to find an optimal height of a dike in a nuclear installation. Three methods have been developed to choose the height to avoid an industrial accident.
1-Determination of the height of the dike from a historical database
2-Use of a hydraulic model in order to offer an optimal height of the protective dike
3-Determination of the optimum height of the dike from an economic model
